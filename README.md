# No Main Hand

A simple client-side fabric mod that visually removes the main hand.
The hand in first person as well as the player model main arm are set to be
invisible.

Changing the main hand game option decides which arm is hidden.
The sleeve of the skin can be left enabled or disabled via its vanilla
setting.
